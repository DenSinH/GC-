#### DSP

The DSP `coef` and `rom` files are obtained from Dolphin (they are open source as far as I could tell).

## TODO:
The doc in Dolphin contains some mistakes:
  - ANDF and ANDCF opcodes are swapped
  - 2 in the bits of HALT opcode
    
and lacks some information:
  - Extended opcodes
  - wrapping register function
